Data-driven HT-ATES model 
Created by David Geerts for the PUSH-IT project. 
More information about this model can be found in the paper published by David Geerts (to be published).
If the model is used in any work, please cite that paper.

The data-driven model is created to skip the numerical modelling, which is often time consuming.
This model create the temperature profile of an HT-ATES system in a computationally efficient manner to be used in larger system modelling.

To use it download all the stuff in a folder and import the ATES_obj_publish file.
An example of how to use it is within that file. 

The "results_filtered" file (parquet file) is a dataset that is generated by running a MODFLOW model repeatedly using different parameter settings. The parameters that were changed are:
Porosity of the aquifer, Injected temperature (constant during injection), Ground temperature (uniform in the model), 
horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer, anisotropy of the aquifer (horizontal hydraulic conductivity / vertical hydraulic conductivity),
Thickness of the aquifer, and Total yearly injected volume in m^3/year.
This is used as input data for both the trained machine learning algorithm (see below) as well as the data driven model 

The "Predict_REFF_boostedregression.pkl" file is an extreme gradient boosting algorithm (machine learning) that predicts the recovery efficiency based on the input parameters. This algorithm was trained based on the "AI_train_Reff_pred.py" file.

This data driven model was tested using the following package versions
Python 3.9.18
Numpy 1.26.4
Pandas 2.2.1
Matplotlib 3.8.3 
Pyarrow 15.0.1
Joblib 1.3.2
Scikit-learn 1.3.0
